# VR Multiplayer Template
 
VR and multiplayer are not shown off very often. I wanted to show how you can do a VR game that is multiplayer. And also a nice way to switch between VR/non VR pawns. This code is not perfect, and it has a few bugs still. But its a decent starting point for a multi player VR game.


When you launch the game on a desktop, you can use the following command line options:

* -vr
* -nonvr

## Packages
 * HTV Vive Input Utility
 * Mirror
 * Third Person Sample


## TODO
* Work on mobile build configuration
* Add remote network pairing
* Plenty more things?
